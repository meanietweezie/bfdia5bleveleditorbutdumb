## NOTE: While not reflected in parts of the actual level string or 5b code, all values are 1-indexed rather than 0-indexed (for example, to change a tile in the first row and column, use 1 for each instead of 0, or to change an aspect about the 3rd character, put in 3 instead of 2).
## Info Commands
### /stats-... - Shows statistics on server actions starting from when the bot was added to the server. Applies across any level loaded with the bot
**...leaderboard** - Globally displays a leaderboard ordered by how much someone has used the bot, with an option to be tailored to specific statistics. By default, all specific changes will be reflected (for example, adding a tile array of 3x3 adds nine to the tiles statistic, and changing three properties of a character will add three to the character statistic). Toggling on "onlycommands" will limit this to only how much each command was ran. Leaderboard self-deletes after about 30 seconds.
**...view** - Globally displays an embed of all stats of the server, or a specific user if specified. Message with embed self-deletes after about 30 seconds.
### Miscellaneous
**/cooldowns-view** - Shows the specific cooldowns set to a user or server based on the command ran.
**/help** - i mean do i really
## Level Commands (/level-...)
### ...add-... - Adds a new thing to the level. Using these commands successfully will result in a user cooldown that prevents them from adding new things to the level.

**...tilerect** - Adds an array of up to 5 by 5 tiles to the level in the spot given and based on the emoji put in. All supported emojis are in the spreadsheet linked.
**...roworcolumn** - Inserts a new row or column into the level, copying the contents of the one present and shifting the rest over.
### ...set-... - Sets a specific part of a level. Using these commands successfully will result in a server cooldown that prevents everyone in the server from changing that value. 
**...bg** - Displays a background of choice based on the ID given (up to 12). Also allows to set the viewed background as the one for the level.
**...name** - Changes the name of the level. All keyboard characters are supported, but most non-keyboard characters are removed if inputted.
**...deaths** - Changes the necessary deaths of a level (but who gaf).
### Miscellaneous
**...viewandcopy** - Privately displays the current level. tilex and tiley can be used to specify a specific top-left corner; otherwise, the command set it to the very first tile. ## Char Commands (/char-...)

## Miscellaneous Commands
**/level-copybotstring** - Copies the JSON data of the level read by the bot, allowing for it to be reloaded later.
**/imagetolevel** - Fun little command that'll take an image and convert it to a 5b level. You can customize the widths and lengths with the "customdim" subcommand or scale down the dimensions of the original image yourself with the "scale" subcommand. Note that images with a width or height larger than 400 pixels will automatically be downscaled to be 400x400 or lower.
## Manager Only Commands
Managers are specific people or roles in the server who have access to specific commands that others cannot use.
**/level-reset** - Sets all the tiles of the level to the same tile and allows for a new height and width to be chosen.
**/cooldowns-edit** - Allows to change the cooldowns of any action for that server (however, whether a cooldown is user-based or server-based cannot be edited).

## Admin Only Commands
